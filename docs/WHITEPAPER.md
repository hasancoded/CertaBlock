### 2.2 Core Components

#### 2.2.1 Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer implements the fundamental data structures and chain management logic:

**Block Structure:**

```rust
pub struct Block {
    pub index: u64,                    // Sequential block identifier
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,      // Block creation timestamp
    pub transactions: Vec<String>,     // Transaction payload
    pub previous_hash: String,         // Link to previous block
    pub nonce: u64,                   // Proof-of-work solution
    pub hash: String,                 // Block hash digest
}
```

**Chain Management:**
The blockchain maintains a continuous chain of blocks, starting with a genesis block and extending through mined blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash linking it to its predecessor, ensuring immutability and detecting any attempts at tampering.

**Transaction Types:**
CertaBlock supports multiple transaction types to accommodate diverse use cases:

- **Transfer Transactions**: Token movements between accounts
- **Certificate Transactions**: Digital credential issuance and verification
- **Reward Transactions**: Mining rewards and incentive distributions

#### 2.2.2 Consensus Mechanism

CertaBlock implements a proof-of-work consensus algorithm optimized for moderate computational requirements while maintaining security:

**Mining Process:**

1. **Transaction Collection**: Gather pending transactions from the transaction pool
2. **Block Assembly**: Create a candidate block with collected transactions
3. **Nonce Discovery**: Find a nonce value that produces a hash meeting difficulty requirements
4. **Block Validation**: Verify the block meets all consensus rules
5. **Chain Integration**: Add the validated block to the blockchain

**Difficulty Adjustment:**
The platform supports dynamic difficulty adjustment through API endpoints, allowing network administrators to balance security requirements with mining efficiency based on network conditions.

#### 2.2.3 Smart Contract System

The ContractExecutor provides a foundation for smart contract functionality, currently implemented for certificate management with extensibility for additional contract types:

**Certificate Contract Features:**

- **Issuance**: Create new digital certificates with unique identifiers
- **Verification**: Validate certificate authenticity and status
- **Reward Distribution**: Automatic token rewards for verified certificates
- **Status Tracking**: Maintain certificate lifecycle and verification states

### 2.3 Token System

CertaBlock includes a comprehensive fungible token system supporting:

**Core Token Operations:**

- **Minting**: Create new tokens for rewards or initial distributions
- **Transfer**: Move tokens between accounts with balance validation
- **Balance Inquiry**: Query account balances and transaction history

## 3. Consensus Mechanism

### 3.1 Proof-of-Work Implementation

CertaBlock implements a SHA-256 based proof-of-work consensus mechanism designed to provide security while maintaining reasonable computational requirements for educational and enterprise environments.

**Algorithm Specification:**

The mining algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Input Preparation**: Combine block data including index, transactions, timestamp, and previous hash
2. **Nonce Iteration**: Systematically try different nonce values starting from 0
3. **Hash Computation**: Calculate SHA-256 hash of the combined input and nonce
4. **Difficulty Check**: Verify if the hash begins with the required number of zeros
5. **Solution Validation**: Return the successful nonce and corresponding hash

**Difficulty Mechanics:**

The difficulty parameter determines the number of leading zeros required in the block hash. This creates an adjustable computational challenge that can scale with network requirements:

- **Difficulty 1**: Hash must start with "0" (approximately 1 in 16 attempts)
- **Difficulty 2**: Hash must start with "00" (approximately 1 in 256 attempts)
- **Difficulty 3**: Hash must start with "000" (approximately 1 in 4,096 attempts)

**Security Properties:**

The proof-of-work system provides several critical security guarantees:

- **Immutability**: Changing historical blocks requires re-mining all subsequent blocks
- **Consensus**: The longest valid chain represents the authoritative blockchain state
- **Decentralization**: No single entity can control the network without majority computational power
- **Transparency**: All mining operations and solutions are verifiable by network participants

### 3.2 Mining Economics

**Block Rewards:**
While the current implementation focuses on transaction processing rather than cryptocurrency mining, the architecture supports future implementation of:

- **Block Rewards**: Fixed token rewards for successful mining
- **Transaction Fees**: Variable fees based on transaction complexity and network congestion
- **Difficulty-Adjusted Rewards**: Compensation that scales with mining difficulty

**Network Participation:**
The consensus mechanism encourages network participation through:

- **Open Mining**: Any participant can contribute computational resources
- **Transparent Process**: All mining attempts and results are publicly verifiable
- **Merit-Based Selection**: Block acceptance based solely on proof-of-work validity

## 4. Smart Contract Framework

### 4.1 Contract Architecture

CertaBlock's smart contract system is built around the ContractExecutor, which provides a secure, efficient environment for executing deterministic business logic on the blockchain.

**Design Philosophy:**

- **Deterministic Execution**: All contract operations produce predictable, reproducible results
- **State Isolation**: Contract state is managed separately from blockchain state
- **Integration Points**: Seamless interaction between contracts, tokens, and blockchain operations
- **Extensibility**: Modular design supports addition of new contract types

### 4.2 Certificate Management Contracts

The flagship smart contract implementation focuses on digital certificate management, providing comprehensive functionality for educational institutions, professional organizations, and certification bodies.

**Certificate Data Structure:**

```rust
pub struct Certificate {
    pub id: String,           // Unique certificate identifier
    pub issued_to: String,    // Recipient identifier
    pub description: String,  // Certificate details and metadata
    pub verified: bool,       // Verification status flag
}
```

**Core Contract Operations:**

**Certificate Issuance:**

- Creates new certificates with unique identifiers
- Records recipient information and certificate metadata
- Initializes verification status and timestamps
- Integrates with blockchain transaction system

**Certificate Verification:**

- Validates certificate existence and authenticity
- Updates verification status and timestamps
- Provides cryptographic proof of verification
- Enables third-party validation workflows

**Reward Integration:**
The contract system seamlessly integrates with the token system to provide automatic rewards for certificate-related activities:

- **Issuance Incentives**: Rewards for institutions issuing verified certificates
- **Network Participation**: Tokens for mining blocks containing certificate transactions

### 4.3 Contract Execution Model

**Transaction Integration:**
Smart contract operations are tightly integrated with the blockchain transaction system:

1. **Contract Call**: API request triggers smart contract function
2. **State Update**: Contract modifies internal state (certificates, verification status)
3. **Transaction Creation**: Contract operation generates blockchain transaction
4. **Pending Queue**: Transaction added to pending transaction pool
5. **Mining Process**: Transaction included in next mined block
6. **Finalization**: Contract state changes become permanent upon block confirmation

**State Persistence:**
Contract state is maintained in memory during operation, with persistence achieved through blockchain integration. This hybrid approach provides:

- **Fast Access**: In-memory operations for immediate contract execution
- **Permanent Record**: Blockchain storage for transaction history and audit trails
- **Conflict Resolution**: Blockchain serves as authoritative record for dispute resolution
